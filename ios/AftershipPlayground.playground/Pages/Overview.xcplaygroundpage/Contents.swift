## AfterShipRestKit

1. [Initialize the Client](Initialize)
1. [Get a Single Tracking](GetTracking)
1. [Create a Tracking](CreateTracking)
1. [Extending the Client](ExtendingClient)
1. [Error Handling](ErrorHandling)

This module provides a swifty interface to interact with [AfterShip REST API](https://www.aftership.com/docs/api/4). It is also my solution to [one of the AfterShip challanges on GitHub](https://github.com/AfterShip/challenge/tree/mobile-1)

- important: This playground only works by opening the [aftership.xcworkspace](.//aftership.xcworkspace)

- experiment: You can have a lot more fun playing if you get a AfterShip API key. [which you can create one here](https://www.aftership.com/apps/api)
